The Bioinformatics Knowledge Base has been developed to benefit anyone who is interested in the subject but does not know where to start. The knowledge about Bioinformatics is scattered and non-systematic. There are classes online but some of them goes into too much detail about a tool that is not necessary. So we decided to create a knowledge base that is easy to follow with knowledge that get you foot in the door and you can decide how deep you want to go with the additional information we provide at . This knowledge base includes the tools and concepts we use everyday and also tricks and tip that help us to be efficient. The knowledge base will keep growing as we  

## Getting to know the base

The Knowledge in the Base is aimed to be helpful for people with any level of understanding of Bioinformatics. The information are categorized into following subjects:

- `Basic Unix/Linux Commands`
- `String/text processing`
- `Bioinformatics Tools`
- `Docker and Docker commands`
- `IDE`
- `Additional Tools to make Life Easier`
- `Language`
- `SGE Knowledge`
- `Concept of NGS`
- `Resources`

**ProTip:** Be sure to go through the knowledge base in the order they are intended. Each subject has the assumption that you have mastered the tools or concepts from the previous one

### Curriculums

The knowledge base is created under the impression that we are all self-disciplined and great at time-management (wink, wink; nudge, nudge). The curriculum is create to assist us to test or find out how well we have understand the concept. It contains HackerRank/Codewar tests, webpages that has tutorial and checkpoints for the specific topic and papers that use the topic in greater details.

### Books to Read

There are many books to read about the topics about that can range from O'Reily online books to hundred-page long deep-dive into genetics. This is the next step you can take after completing the knowledge base. This will help you become a proficient bioinformatics engineer!

That's it! If all goes well you well-equipped with bioinformatics knowledge and should be able to apply them right away! Best of luck!

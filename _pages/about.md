We are passionate bioinformatics who wants to share the knowledge with all who are interested and want to learn more. When we tried to look for materials for studying and improving ourselves, we are surprised by how scattered and disorganized the knowledge for this field is. So we decided to take matter to our hands and make it easier for people to get to know this field and improve on it. So please enjoy and we are always open to suggestions.

Enjoy the ride!
